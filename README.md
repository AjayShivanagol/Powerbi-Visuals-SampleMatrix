# NOTE

As of Nov 14, 2019 the most recent version of PBIVIZ is producing a malfunctioning visual when packaged with "pbiviz package". 

Unless fixed in the future PBIVIZ releases, I would suggest that you use the older PBIVIZ toolset of verions 2.5.0. 

To install it run: 

npm install -g powerbi-visuals-tools@2.5.0
